Phantasy Star 1 - Mobile Demo is a demo version sent to TecToy in 2009 developed by Jonathan S. Santos.

This version contains:

*** SEGA'Intro
*** Title Screen
*** Introduction Cut Scenes
*** Alis Walking in Caminet city.
============

Nowadays, to run this demo, my suggestion is: 'J2ME Loader' for Android. Download 'release/phantasystar.jar' and launch using the emulator.
